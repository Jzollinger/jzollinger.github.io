          <h1>Why Magnesium?</h1>

          <div id="magEnergy">
            <p>nfuse deodorants and lotions are not only formulated with clinically proven, safe and naturally derived ingredients to deliver maximum efficacy but are also formulated to boost whole body wellness. Every morning and night, when you swipe on your nfuse deodorant and rub in your nfuse lotion, you are treating yourself to a healthy dose of magnesium.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="gold">What’s the big deal?</h3>
            <p>Despite its importance, most of us don’t get enough magnesium in our diets. Why...a combination of low dietary intake coupled with over-farmed soil & mineral-deficient water and sleep deprivation, constant stress, and too much alcohol, caffeine and processed food. So this is where nfuse comes in...we’ve figured out a way to sneak this mineral into a pleasurable self care routine, everyday.</p>
          </div>

          <div id="magPerformance">
            <h3 class="gold">How?</h3>
            <p>One relatively unknown advantage of magnesium is that an optimal delivery mechanism is through the skin. You can’t say that about too many other vitamins and minerals! The skin is able to absorb magnesium it needs while avoiding reduced bio-availability due to gut or digestive issues.</p>
            <p class="down">nfuse takes it even one step farther and is unlike anything else out there. Our patented technology creates a virtual patch that delivers the magnesium deep into the skin and holds it there, so it has time to diffuse into the body.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="gold benefits">What are the benefits of magnesium?</h2>
            <h3 class="green">Natural pain relief</h3>
            <p>Clinical experience, as well as research in nerve pain conditions, has demonstrated that magnesium can be an effective treatment for pain. A major mechanism of pain is the excessive stimulation of a brain chemical called NMDA. Magnesium sits inside the NMDA receptors and balances this pain-carrying neurotransmitter. As magnesium is also a natural muscle relaxant, application to sore muscles and joints can provide pain and ache relief.</p>
          </div>

          <div id="magSleep">
            <h3 class="green">Cramps be gone</h3>
            <p>If you suffer from leg cramps, many experts believe magnesium can help. Magnesium is a natural antispasmodic. In the body, magnesium helps move calcium and potassium across cell membranes, which is required for healthy neuromuscular transmission and contraction. Therefore, if your body is magnesium-deficient, you may experience more frequent muscle spasms or cramping.</p>
          </div>

          <div id="magStress">
            <h3 class="green">Nature’s chill pill</h3>
            <p>Magnesium is known as the relaxation mineral. It supports adrenal function and can reduce the release of the stress hormone ACTH (the hormone that tells your adrenal glands to pump out cortisol and adrenaline), as well as acting as a filter to prevent stress hormones from entering the brain. On top of making your body relax, magnesium plays a part in synthesizing serotonin which regulates anxiety, happiness and mood. No wonder magnesium is known as nature’s chill pill...it can actually help you to feel relaxed and happy.</p>
          </div>

          <div id="magDetox">
            <h3 class="green">Get more Zs….</h3>
            <p>Magnesium supplementation has been shown to help people both fall asleep and stay asleep. Magnesium regulates both neurotransmitters and melatonin. Magnesium helps calm your nervous system by binding to GABA receptors. These neurotransmitters reduce nerve activity, promote relaxation and calm the nervous system in preparation for sleep. Because it has a calming effect on the nervous system, recent studies suggest magnesium may also help treat any underlying depression and anxiety that’s contributing to insomnia.</p>
            <p class="down">In addition, researchers have found that melatonin and magnesium levels correlate in the body. Those with low magnesium levels sleep less and vice versa. Based on these findings, researchers concluded that, like melatonin, magnesium is tied to your circadian rhythms.</p>
          </div>

          <div id="magSkin">
            <h3 class="green">Oh, my aching head!</h3>
            <p>Migraine sufferers have lower levels of intracellular magnesium during acute migraine attacks, according to research. Low levels of magnesium affect a number of related receptors and neurotransmitters that cause migraine headaches. Multiple studies have shown that magnesium supplementation decreases migraine frequency and severity.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="green">Women’s Health</h3>
            <p>PMS: magnesium is thought to help relieve symptoms associated with PMS; particularly bloating, insomnia, leg swelling, weight gain, and breast tenderness. Some researchers propose that it may work by calming the nervous system and by normalizing the actions of different hormones on the central nervous system.</p>
            <p class="down">Period cramping: magnesium may prevent menstrual cramps in some people by relaxing the smooth muscle of the uterus and by reducing prostaglandins, which are the inflammatory compounds that drive period pain.</p>
            <p class="down">Menopause: studies show that daily magnesium supplementation greatly reduces hot flashes and night sweats in pre-menopausal and menopausal women. Mood changes, common in pre menopause and menopause, are also positively affected by assuring adequate magnesium levels</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="green">Heart health</h3>
            <p>Because magnesium is important for transporting potassium and calcium into cells, healthy Mg levels are necessary for preventive heart health. Initial research studies show magnesium protects the heart through the support and maintenance of normal blood pressure and heart beat.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="green">Perform at your peak</h3>
            <p>Boosts energy: Athletes need adequate magnesium levels to perform at their best as magnesium aids in the production, storage and transport of energy. Studies have shown that magnesium-deficient individuals exercise performance improves with magnesium supplementation.</p>
            <p class="down">Maintains optimal muscle performance: magnesium regulates muscle contraction and relaxation which is critical during and post workout.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="green">Detox</h3>
            <p>Magnesium protects the body from harmful toxins and the brain from the deposit of heavy metals like aluminum, lead, and mercury.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="green">Beautiful skin</h3>
            <p>When applying magnesium to the skin, it breaks apart different fats and oils and reduces oil production of the sebum, which makes it a useful tool for combating acne and breakouts. For all its acne fighting capabilities, magnesium also hydrates the skin -- playing double duty to create healthy balanced skin. In addition, due to magnesium’s ability to regulate cortisol and its anti-inflammatory powers, many believe it may help with skin irritations like rosacea and inflammatory skin conditions like eczema.</p>
