              <h1>Our Story</h1>
              <p>It all started when we were on a family vacation and Ann's husband Peter, who has worked with magnesium his whole life, was talking about the powerful health benefits of this relatively unknown mineral. Intrigued, we began to look into it. Once we started, we couldn't stop. Over 50% of Americans' diets are deficient in this essential mineral. And this nutrient is important - almost every part of the body depends on it, it reduces stress, relaxes muscles, protects the heart, improves sleep... you name it, magnesium plays a part.</p>

          <p>We started taking magnesium ourselves and felt revitalized, but oral supplements had downsides. Like most women, we were too busy managing our own lives and those around us - we wanted an easy way to make magnesium part of our daily routine. Was there a better way to deliver magnesium?</p>
          <p>Our lucky break came on a trip to South America where we learned that milk of magnesia is used as a deodorant.  In addition to the multiple health benefits, could magnesium cure an everyday problem as annoying as body odor? We had to find out.</p>
          <p>Once at home, we started experimenting using a proprietary, concentrated blend of magnesium combined with safe, natural ingredients. And it worked! No smell and smooth, beautiful-looking skin. We gave it to family and friends, and soon they were pounding on our doors for more. Not only did it make them smell good, it made them feel good too.</p>
          <p>We wanted to be sure that we had the safest and most effective product available, so we brought it to a chemist with experience in natural skin care formulation and drug delivery. Using innovative naturally-derived ingredients, he improved our formula even further by enhancing absorption of magnesium, making the deodorant seamlessly smooth to the skin during application, and not to mention completely self-preserving.</p>
          <p>Now, after years of research, development, and experimentation we are proud to share nfuse™ - a deodorant done different. A natural deodorant that works. A deodorant that we, as daughters of a breast cancer survivor, feel good putting on ourselves and our teenage kids.
