          <h1>Care Tips</h1>

          <p>nfuse isn’t just a natural deodorant or body lotion but a handy tool to add magnesium into your daily personal care routine. That makes nfuse different, and we’re here to share some tips to let you know what to expect and to make it the best experience possible for you.</p>

          <div>
            <h3 class="bold">Overall Care Tips:</h3>
            <h3 class="">Less is More</h3>
            <p>A little goes a long way, especially in the beginning. One, or at most two, swipes of nfuse deo per underarm and a pump of nfuse body lotion is a great way to start. Pro tips: Start slow & gradually work up to larger amounts as your body adjusts.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="">Let it Breathe</h3>
            <p>After shaving, treat your delicate underarms and freshly-shaved skin with some kindness and wait before applying deodorant and lotion. When you shave, you’re basically creating tiny cuts on your skin and applying nfuse when they’re freshly hairless can cause redness and irritation. Pro-tips: make sure to swap out your old razor for a smooth, clean shave. Apply a gentle moisturizer to tender underarms or freshly shaven legs to heal skin prior to applying nfuse.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="">Feeling Tingly?</h3>
            <p>Don’t worry, some people feel a tingling sensation at first. That’s the magnesium doing its work! One reason: magnesium is a vasodilator and causes an increased blood flow in your capillaries which can cause a temporary tingling sensation. Some studies suggest it’s especially true if you are deficient in magnesium. Pro-tip: Give it time. The sensation should subside with gradual consistent use and as magnesium levels rise.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="bold">Deodorant Care Tips:</h3>
            <h3 class="">Underarm Detox</h3>
            <p>If you’re making the switch to a natural deodorant, you may experience a short detox period (up to two weeks). Trust us - it’s worth the wait! It’s your body getting rid of aluminum and other chemicals that remain after you make the healthy switch. Pro-tip: as you adjust, feel free to reapply often. Magnesium, nfuse’s #1 ingredient, is a natural detoxifier that helps remove heavy metals and other toxins from your body.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="">Sweat is Healthy</h3>
            <p>nfuse is not an antiperspirant. We don’t use sweat blockers like aluminum that clog your sweat glands and block the body’s healthy process of sweating. Your body needs to sweat to cool down and release toxins. Pro-tip: Avoid tight fitting and synthetic clothing fabrics that can irritate the underarms.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="">Keep it Clean</h3>
            <p>Apply on clean, dry skin. For the roll-on deo, give the bottle a couple of good shakes and apply 2-3 swipes per underarm. For the gel deo, twist the dial on the bottom of the stick until the gel begins to appear through the holes at the top. Gently massage the gel into your underarms with the applicator. Pro-tip: Leave some time to let it absorb into your skin before dressing.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="">Clothing Friendly</h3>
            <p>Unlike aluminum based antiperspirants that leave yellow stains, magnesium based nfuse will not stain your clothes. Pro-tip: If you get white marks on your clothes, they are easily wiped off with a damp cloth or will come off in the next load of laundry.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="bold">Lotion Care Tips:</h3>
            <h3 class="">Not your Mother’s Body Butter</h3>
            <p>You’ll see - and feel- the difference at the first pump. Lightweight with a gel texture and invisible application, this non-greasy lotion glides on to smooth the look of skin. With a water-like feel, a little goes a long way. Pro-tip: Start with a small pump and evenly apply all over your body. Pamper yourself with some extra lotion in any areas where you need a little extra TLC.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="">Soak it up:</h3>
            <p>Use a pump or two, massage onto your body and give yourself a couple minutes to absorb the magnesium goodness. Avoid direct contact with your eyes, mucus membranes or broken skin. Do not apply immediately after shaving. Pro tip: Put it on after a warm shower and let it fully absorb while you brush your teeth. If possible, avoid tight-fitting clothing to reduce friction and allow your skin to breathe.</p>
